# Introduction #

Ares takes place on earth in the year 2053. So the general style should be contemporary and slightly futuristic. Also note that there is alien technology and alien spaceships.

A big part of the game takes part in the western part of Belgium (near the coast). Most big cities have been hit by the initial alien attack and humankind has learned to fight back by not providing many central big locations. So there are lots of relatively small military bases scattered around the world. One of them is near Oostende, a medium sized city near the coast.

We are not going to restrict the game to that area. With some quests the player could be transported to one of the ruined cities (Brussels, Paris, London, ...?) in order to do some missions and there are of course also other possibilities.

# Outside Areas #

Currently there is only one outside area and that is the western part of Belgium. All levels are located inside that area. In the future more areas can be added.

  * [Area of Oostende](StoryLevelOutsideOostende.md): this describes the area outside Oostende. This will be the first outside map of the game.

# Levels #

  * [Training Camp](StoryLevelCamp.md): The first level would be the training camp where our hero is trained as a soldier. The training is nearing its end and with a few minigames the player can choose his or her attributes. There should be a few training areas in this level and the possibility to interact with some NPC's. Some of them might give clues useful for future quest lines (i.e. there could be a spy in the camp although you wouldn't know that at first).
  * [Oostende](StoryLevelOostende.md): near the camp there is a small city (since I'm from Belgium I thought to pick a coastal city near the Belgian coastline, any place in Europe is just as good as any since this is a global problem, so why not there?).
  * [StoryLevelAirportOostende](StoryLevelAirportOostende.md): Oostende has an airport which has been mostly rebuild after the war as a military airport. There is one section where spaceships can launch.
