# Introduction #

Here is a proposal on how the NPC faction system could work.

First thing to note is that there are the three goals of the game:
  * Human victory
  * Enemy victory
  * Diplomacy

Every NPC has a preference indicator for each of these three victory conditions. For example, a human army general is likely to have values like these:
  * Human victory: 80%
  * Enemy victory: 0%
  * Diplomacy: 50%

So he prefers a human victory but is not completely opposed to a diplomatic solution.

A human merchant may have this:
  * Human victory: 70%
  * Enemy victory: 30% (maybe an alien already offered him a nice reward)
  * Diplomacy: 20% (can't make much money out of a peace situation)

Various actions in the game can influence these numbers. If an NPC has a high 'Will' or 'Charisma' stat (to be decided) then this could make it harder to influence the NPC to switch to another side.

In general NPCs might be more inclined to switch to the some side depending on quests and perhaps also on mini-games.
