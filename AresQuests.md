# Introduction #

For the three possible victories there are the following final goals:
  * Human victory: destroy the alien mothership that is in orbit around Earth.
  * Alien victory: destroy the human defense grid.
  * Diplomatic victory: arrange a meeting between the top leaders of both the aliens and the humans.

These three victories are controlled by the three main quests. Note that the player can actually proceed in these three quests at once (although there will be conflicting situations in some cases when he does that):

  * [Main diplomatic victory quest](QuestMainVictoryDiplomatic.md)
