Here are a few alien concept art proposals from Hannes Kartherl. At this moment they are not licensed yet so you are not free to use this for any purpose. Will update later:

### Concept 1 ###

The ships and robots of this species are for the most part made out of metal and work mechanically. Sensible parts are armored with thick metal plates. Only the sensors are organic material. Organic skin, tentacles, eyes and antennas look through smaller holes in the metal plates. For example on arms and hands are a lot of eyeballs to have a very accurate overview of all objects in the environment.
The moving mechanical parts are very functional and dynamically designed. You can see a lot of cylinders, shock absorbers and suspensions. Luminous cables around the hole thing bring the energy to organic and mechanical parts.

### Concept 2 ###

This concept is perfectly hybrid. The skeleton ist built of mechanical bones out of metal. So the crafts keep very stable. Organic muscles connect the metal parts together and move them. Some muscles glow partially. The most sensoric is also done with organic parts - ears, eyes, horns,...
Also some organs are needed to pump blood through the muscles and other bodies.
All in all this crafts (especially the robots) have a really disgusting look because of the mixture of biologic and technologic parts.

### Concept 3 ###

Now this cencept is very horrific and ugly! A dark metal skeleton stabilizing strange shaped glass containers with partially glowing organic stuff and liquid inside. The mechanical parts have the control of the hole body. The more protected (or better to say "caged") organs are used to produce energy for the engines and motors of the bots and ships. To transform this biologic energy, a lot of cables and extra parts are placed around each glass container.
Also the pilot is inside a special glass container, connected directly with other organs. I imagine the pilot not to be one single body, but to be a cluster of fixed organs irrevocably integreted in the craft.
...like i said, very very creepy!

### Concept 4 ###

Ok, here is some very different style! Until now all the concepts were very dark and creepy and mysterious. Technologically advanced aliens could also look graceful and fascinating! This species's crafts are armored with smooth, heavy, shiny metal parts and use handy but heavily destructive energy weapons. The musculoskeletal system is fully biological. You can see a lot of little glowing muscle fibers between the armor plates. The sensoric is also done with organs like eyes, mouths, hairs and skin (like in concept #1 and #2).
Here, the mixture of bio and mecha doesn't look creepy and ugly, but suitable in a very dynamic way. No cables are stabbed inside organs, no blood is seen, it is a cooperation between both technologies packed into a functional design.
