AresEd is a high-level and fully featured 3D game creation suite. It is Free and Open Source. When it is finished you will be able to make full 3D games without writing any code (although a fallback to the python scripting language will be provided). AresEd is based on the Crystal Space 3D engine and on Crystal Entity Layer for game logic. It is also based on WX for the user interface and Bullet for physics. The editor is fully physics based and shows a realtime preview of the game world.

  * **15 November 2012**: Project Ares is looking for C++ developers! AresEd is already evolving fast but we need help to really get AresEd in a great state and to be able to make more complete games.

  * **12 November 2012**: [Hakin9 Magazine](http://hakin9.org/) prepared for us content concerning advanced IT security. It is now available for free and all you need to do is create a free account at www.hakin9.org . Their current edition addresses one of the most recognized and popular IT security network scanners. This professional programs provides users with easy access to a large, comprehensive collection of security-related tools, ranging from port scanners to password crackers. Thanks to co-operation with BackTrack (BT,Nessus,Snort creators and a group of professional specialists who wrote specific articles for us, we were able to cover specific toolkits and possible uses in one publication. This suite of security tools has been wonderfully described from different points of view, giving us the excellent content presented, below. Looking through the list of articles, you’ll find thematic sections, presenting each author’s work. We devided our content into sections concerning each one of the biggest network scanners in the world. [Get this digest for free!!](http://hakin9.org/the-best-of-network-scanning-digest-012012/)

  * **25 July 2012**: Work is still underway but focus is now more on the Ares Game Editor and less on the actual game. I think it is better to have a usable game editor before work on the game can really start.

Start reading at the MainPage.
