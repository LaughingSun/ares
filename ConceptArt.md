# Wanted #

Here is a list of concept art that we need (incomplete list):

  * Spaceship section of the airport. This needs to be a ground-based spaceship section where relatively big spaceships can land and take off. I imagine this to be a deep pit of about 1 square km. The walls of the pit should have a highly technological feel to them. The spaceships are standing inside the pit with walkways extended so that the crew can get on them.
  * Human spaceships. Should be relatively modern (2047-2053) but still what can be realistically expected then.
  * Alien spaceships.
  * Alien mothership (HUGE thing hiding behind the moon).
  * Military base annoy 2053.
  * Destroyed section of Oostende.
  * Aliens. The aliens should look alien (duh!) and fearsome but nevertheless it should be possible to imagine a diplomatic solution with them. Perhaps we can even have multiple classes of aliens. Imagine that the aliens are actually different species where the main race (the 'boss/intelligent' race) doesn't do a lot of fighting but perhaps they employ other races to do that.
  * Various human armor (anno 2053) and weapons.
  * Various alien armor and weapons.
  * Various hybrid armor and weapons (mixed technology, may look a little bit crude because it was made with limited resources).
  * Various human robots.
  * Various alien robots.
