Legend:
  * The orange area is the military base where the player starts.
  * The blue parts are both the airport and spaceship port controlled by the human military.
  * The red part is alien occupied territory.
  * The grey part represents civilian buildings.
  * The black fuzzy circle is an impact crater. The surroundings of that crater are light radioactive and mostly destroyed.
  * The dotted area is a military guarded fenced-off area. There are no human inhabitants in that area.
  * The station is unusable because the main part of the railway was destroyed by the impact. So the building is mostly in decay.
  * The harbor is being used by the military and also by the civilians.
