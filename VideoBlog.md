# Video Blog #

## 13 Februari 2012 ##

This is my fourth Ares Video Blog entry. A lot has changed since the last video blog. In this demonstration I show how you can make a simple (very simple) game using AresEd. A few disclaimers:
  * AresEd is work in progress. There are still bugs and the user interface could be better.
  * My microphone isn't good. Sound quality is not that good.
  * The video encoder I used apparently caused a choppy framerate. AresEd runs much smoother in reality.
  * I cut away a part in the middle where something wasn't working properly :-)

This latest video is a remake of my old AresEd video. It is made using better technology (no more video camera of my laptop screen) and shows a few new features (moving foliage/grass and some editing improvements).

This video is more technical and demonstrates how CEL supports lots of entities (about 10 million) with clever bookkeeping and managing of (modified) state.

In this video we demonstrate the basic functionality of the AresEd game editor. This is obviously work in progress and the video was also made using a video camera. So not very high quality.
