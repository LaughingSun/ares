# Introduction #

Here is a list of possible stats that we could have in Ares. It has not been decided yet which stats we will actually have:

  * Strength: influences how much you can carry (note that I don't want a hard limit. You can carry as much as you want but if you carry more you will gradually start walking/running slower) and the power of melee attacks.
  * Endurance: influences your health and how quickly you heal.
  * Intelligence: how good are you with science and assembling complicated machinery (crafting).
  * Wisdom: do we need this? Perhaps this would be more fantasy oriented.
  * Will: could be useful in association with charisma? Also NPC's could use this to prevent influencing to other factinos.
  * Luck: maybe?
  * Perception: how good do we see things.
  * Charisma: sounds related to will in some respects. Influences bartering and also the chance of persuading some NPC to do something.
