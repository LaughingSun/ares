# Introduction #

In Ares it will be possible to make new tools, weapon and armor using various technology items that you can find. You will be able to do the following:

  * Dismantle human and alien devices (provided you have the right tools) to get the parts.
  * Assemble parts again into various configurations (again provided you have the right tools).
  * Fix existing devices using replacement parts.

To do any kind of crafting work you need to be at a 'Workbench'. In addition you will also need various tools depending on what you're actually making. Crafting could be implemented like a mini-game where you see a schematic and then using that schematic you have to drag various parts to it. The system can be very flexible. Maybe you don't have all the parts you need to craft something. Or maybe you have different parts that almost do the same. It would be nice if we could allow for this and perhaps this would result in lower-quality versions of the same item.
