# Introduction #

The goal of Project Ares is to make three things:

  * AresEd: A world editor specific for Ares (can't be used as a generic world editor for other CS apps) in which you can make a game world and define the game logic.
  * A game player that can play games created by the editor.
  * An actual [game](AresGame.md) that uses this technology. Note the actual game has been put on hold until the AresEd tool is more mature.
