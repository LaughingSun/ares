# Introduction #

The game takes place in 2053. In this section we list the history of events preceeding 2053.

  * **12 April 2047**: Earth is attacked by surprise by a big alien force. Lots of alien spaceships were hiding behind the moon and they attacked most major earth cities. Many big cities were completely or partially destroyed by light radioactive explosions. This was done with a big number of smaller explosive weapons. Due to this many cities were only partially destroyed because human defense mechanism managed to destroy a few of these projectiles after the first explosions.
  * **13 April 2047**: After the initial surprise humankind manages to completely fire up its defense mechanism and manages to prevent further destruction. Nevertheless millions of people have died and the chaos is huge.

  * **2048**: during entire 2048 the fight continues but the aliens can't manage to cause much more damage anymore.
  * **22 May 2048**: The United Nations and the NATO agree to set aside all local conflicts and work together against the common enemy. All nations boundaries are (temporarily?) opened and all the earth military forces are put under control of the NATO.
  * **2049**: out of desperation the aliens change tactics and land on earth. They try to occupy territory gradually. Of course this is 'alien' territory for them and generally the aliens have a hard time keeping their ground despite their superior technology.
  * **2050**: by this time many aliens and humans realize the war is going nowhere fast and mini-aliances are being made.
