# Introduction #

The Ares Project is the name for the actual game demo which we're going to make based on AresEd.

# Basic Story #

In 2047 the world was attacked by surprise by an alien force. Many cities were wiped out and as a result large parts of the world have become uninhabitable. However, mankind strikes back. By 2047 the human race was already advanced enough to recover and effectively block further alien attacks. This is the situation in 2053 when the game starts. The war is at a stalemate and neither side can manage to get the advantage over the other. The player has to alter the balance so that the human race just gets that little edge over the aliens to be able to counter the invastion.

During the past six years several interesting things have happened. A number of aliens, unhappy with the current situation, formed a separate 'rebel' faction and now want to make peace with humans. Several of these aliens have moved to Earth. Most humans are not very friendly against these aliens but some have come to accept them. Many humans are getting tired of the war and agree that peace would be far preferable then the situation right now. However, there is still a considerable number of people who believe they can still defeat the aliens. On the other hand there are also a few people (but not many) who believe that it would actually be better if the alien race got to rule over mankind. Most of these people were offered big rewards and good positions in a possible future world as ruled by the aliens. Some of these humans are now actually working on the alien spaceships and a few work undercover on Earth in order to spy for the aliens.

The hero has to find his place among these factions and decide his or her goals in life. He or she has been trained by the European Army with the intention of infiltrating in an alien stronghold and trying to neutralize them from within. However, once the game unfolds the hero has to make decisions and perhaps it would be better if he or she went over to the alien camp?

# Game Goals #

There are several ways to win the game:
  * The hero can achieve the goals for which he or she was trained and manages to neutralize the aliens. Mankind is victorious and the aliens are driven from the planet.
  * The hero can achieve a more diplomatic solution where both sides agree to cease hostilities and instead decide to share resources and technology.
  * The hero can side with the aliens and help the alien race to get domination over Earth. The hero ends up rich and in a influencial position among the alien government.

# Discussion #

This is of course a big idea but it easy to do this in very small steps.

Mind you, I don't just want a simple FPS shooter. I'm thinking more along the lines of a single player RPG with different possible story elements and conversations with NPC's.

Note, this is just an idea. I'm open to other suggestions as well.

_(kickvb: the biggest problem for a game is its assets: coding is a small part of the job when compared to the artistic work needed (meshes, sounds, animations, textures, etc). This constraint can lead the choice of the game: either use assets you already have (eg from YoFrankie) or choose a game where assets are less needed, eg by having the users creating part of the content. I have an old idea that never get out of my head of doing a Supreme Commander-like with customizable robots: you define robot bricks (motors, body, weapons) and the user combine them to build robots.)_
